    Dummy API-Gateway
</h2>

## Description

The project is not intended to be used in a production environment. It is a classic API-Gateway, capable of proxying HTTP requests through itself. The project is a simple implementation, that is, apart from proxying requests nothing else is implemented (at least at the moment), so feel free if you want to use this project for some testing purposes.
